Tasks.

Store Hours are in widget Footer2 Sidebar

Spring (and reverse in fall)
--------------------------------
 - change top blue bar:
    Woocommerce -> settings-> general -> Store Notice Text
      usually something like "Now Open for the 2016 Season!" or
      "Now Closed for hte 2016 Season.";

- change red banner on home page.
  in-season:  Open seven days a week!!!
  end of season:  Closing for season saturday,
  off-season:  See you in the spring.

- change store hours in Footer2 widget area.
  in season usually
      <h3 align=\"center\">Popping 7 Days a Week!</h3>
      <p align=\"center\">11 am to 5:00 pm, daily</p>

- enable manage inventory
    Woocommerce -> settings -> products -> inventory -> manage inventory checkbox.

- change all products to not in stock (quick edit)

- remove template file for woocommerce/single-product/add-to-cart/variation-add-to-cart-button.php
  this hides the add to cart button and the number of items input field.
  there must be a better way to do this, but I havent found it yet.
